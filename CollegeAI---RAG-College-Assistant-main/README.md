# CollegeAI — Production RAG-Based College Chatbot

CollegeAI is a production-grade AI-powered college information assistant built with a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline. Users can register, upload college documents (PDFs, DOCXs, TXT notices, academic calendars, hostel handbooks, exam regulations, and placement circulars), and ask complex campus-related questions. The system extracts relevant passages from the indexed documents and generates grounded answers with verifiable source citations and page numbers.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

1. **Grounded RAG Pipeline**:
   - Semantic text extraction for PDF, DOCX, and TXT documents.
   - Text chunking (500–1000 characters) with overlap preservation.
   - 768-dimensional vector embeddings with cosine similarity retrieval.
   - Zero hallucination policy: If an answer cannot be verified in the uploaded documents, the AI explicitly states it cannot find the information.
2. **Document Citations & Source Inspection**:
   - Every answer includes citations linking directly to the source document, page number, and chunk index.
   - Interactive Source Modal to preview verbatim passages and relevance scores.
3. **Multi-Document & Scoped Queries**:
   - Search across all uploaded knowledge base files or filter to specific documents.
4. **Authentication & Multi-Tenant Isolation**:
   - User registration and login with bcrypt password hashing and JWT sessions.
   - Strict data isolation: documents and chunks are scoped strictly to the authenticated user.
5. **Interactive UI / UX**:
   - Full conversation history with chronological grouping (Today, Yesterday, Previous Days).
   - Markdown rendering with tables, code formatting, bullet points, and copy actions.
   - Document chunk inspector and 1-click sample document loader.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed.
- (Optional) `GEMINI_API_KEY` for live AI generation. (A high-speed deterministic vectorizer and structured response engine is included as an automatic fallback).

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file from `.env.example`:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
```

### 3. Run in Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Deploy Frontend and Backend

The repository includes a root-level `render.yaml` for the Express backend. Deploy the two parts separately:

### Backend on Render

1. Create a Render Blueprint from this GitHub repository, or create a Web Service manually.
2. If configuring manually, use these settings:
   - Root Directory: `CollegeAI---RAG-College-Assistant-main`
   - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build:server`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
   - Health Check Path: `/api/health`
3. Add these environment variables in Render:

```text
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=<long-random-secret>
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>
PORT=10000
```

Copy the deployed backend URL, for example `https://collegeai-backend.onrender.com`.

### Frontend on Vercel

1. Import the same GitHub repository into Vercel.
2. Set Root Directory to `CollegeAI---RAG-College-Assistant-main`.
3. Use the Vite preset, with Build Command `npm run build:client` and Output Directory `dist`.
4. Add this environment variable, using your real Render URL:

```text
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://collegeai-backend.onrender.com
```

Deploy Vercel after saving the variable. Test the backend first at `<backend-url>/api/health`, then open the Vercel URL, register, upload a document, wait for `Indexed`, and ask a question.

### Persistence warning

The current embedded database writes JSON files under `data/` and uploaded files under `uploads/`. Render's local filesystem is temporary, so this setup is suitable for demos but can lose data after restarts or redeploys. For production, migrate the database and uploaded files to persistent services before relying on user data.

## 🧪 Demo Credentials

For quick evaluation, use the built-in demo credentials:
- **Email**: `alex.student@college.edu`
- **Password**: `college123`
